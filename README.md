- [x] Instead of hard coding the `fontFamily` and `fontSize`, we should be able to allow the user to choose a font size and font family of their choice (which they have installed on their machine).

- [x] Apply styles without reloading whenever the settings are changed from the browser action popup interface.
- [x] If no custom font styles are set, load GitHub's default font styles.
- [x] User can reset font styles to GitHub's default font styles.
- [ ] Allow user to apply styles to either font family or font size instead of both being required.
