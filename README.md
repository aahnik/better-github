## Todo
- Instead of hard coding the `fontFamily` and `fontSize`, we should be able to allow the user to choose a font size and font family of their choice (which they have installed on their machine).
    - [x] Create a browser action popup to show expose an interface to allow the
        user to edit `fontFamily` and `fontSize`.
    - [] Integrate browser action popup with chrome API to persist and read
        user's settigs to customize the Github code text.
